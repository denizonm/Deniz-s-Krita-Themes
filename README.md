# Deniz's Krita Themes

Krita's looking very cute today.

These are mostly based on Obsidian community themes. Purple Haze is Mado Miniflow and Hacker is WY Console. The rest have the same names.

- Put all the files in the "color-schemes" folder (its a folder that's inside the resource folder that just opened up.
